# sigma-pyscf-demo

Demo scripts/notebooks related to the usage of sigma-functional in PySCF

- Simple examples to run non-spin-polarized and spin-polarized calculations: [ipynb](https://github.com/EgorTrushin/sigma-pyscf-demo/blob/main/examples.ipynb)
- Examples to reproduce results produced by Molpro: [ipynb](https://github.com/EgorTrushin/sigma-pyscf-demo/blob/main/reproduce_molpro.ipynb)
- Calculations of reaction energies for W4-11RE dataset, including short analysis of deviations from reference values: [ipynb](https://github.com/EgorTrushin/sigma-pyscf-demo/blob/main/W4_11RE.ipynb)
- py scripts repeat code from notebooks with examples and Molpro reproducibility
